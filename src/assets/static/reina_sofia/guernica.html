<p>So I am going to give you a little&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/highereducation.news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish history</a>&nbsp;to help you understand why exactly this is considered one of the most famous pieces of Spanish art. No worries if you don&rsquo;t like it&hellip; but take a step back and try to see it from the perspective of a Spaniard during the Civil War.</p>
<p>The piece is named for the small Northern Spanish town, Gernika, in Basque Country that was bombed by the Germans during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Picasso saw photographs in newspapers while living in Paris, and was inspired to complete this particular work when a poet friend begged him to take on the cause. According to the Reina Sofia&rsquo;s website, it is considered to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&rdquo; a giant poster, (a) testimony to the horror that the Spanish Civil War was causing and a forewarning of what was to come in the Second World War.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it was first displayed at the International World Fair in Paris in 1937, it was used to raise money for awareness and aid for Spanish citizens. After a brief period in France, the painting was housed in New York&rsquo;s MOMA until after Franco&rsquo;s rule ended and it came to Spain for the first time in 1981. Since its completion, it has become a symbol of Spanish Democracy.</p>
<p>Make a beeline for this piece, which is located on the second floor. When you get there, stop and really try to take it in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s discombobulated and broken up. There is a frantic energy, but you can still divide the figures into two groups: animals and humans. It is easy to make out a horse in the center of the canvas, a bull on the left side (a common symbol of Spain), and various women crying out. The painting is characterized by muted colors, including a bluish-gray, white, and black. The sheer size of the canvas (just about 11 ft. x&nbsp;25 ft.) impresses on the viewer the terror, pain, and confusion felt in that moment when the bomb fell in Guernica, and that extended throughout the country as a result of the Civil War.</p>
<p>Americans frequently are not taught about the Spanish Civil War, but for anyone who plans on spending some time in Spain, it is worth reading about. After the war, Spain had a dictator, Francisco Franco, for forty years (1939-1975).</p>
