A ver… is a commonly used phrase that is also quite general and versatile. It literally means “let’s see”, but sometimes adults use it, for example, when rallying up a group of children. Basically, you can use this when someone asks you a question and you have to think before answering. Example: ¿Cuántas personas vienen a la cena esta noche? A ver…creo que van a venir José, Mariluz, Ángel, Miguel… Pues entonces cuatro.

(Me) mola means it’s really cool or you dig it. In other words, it’s an alternative to me gusta. Examples: Esa canción mola mucho, ¿eh? or Me mola mucho esa canción.

Hombre in Spain is not just the opposite of a mujer, so don’t be offended if someone says to you, Hombre, claro. Its other use is as an intensifier, a way to express reactions like surprise, urgency, insistence, etc. In English we would use a variety of words, depending on the context. For the example stated previously, you might say, “Well, obviously.”

Vale, vale, vale we understand that you’re a guiri (Peninsular Spanish for gringa), but you cannot leave Spain without this repetitive phrase reverberating in your head! And yes, the Spaniards really do say vale (“okay” or “alright”) three times in a row like that. Not every time, but…just about.
